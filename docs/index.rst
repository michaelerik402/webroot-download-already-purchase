Many users face confusion when transitioning from purchase to installation.

This article applies to both personal and business users and covers multiple scenarios, including online purchases, boxed product versions, and reinstallation after a system reset or device change.

Why Re-Downloading Webroot May Be Necessary
-------------------------------------------

You may need to download Webroot again for several reasons:

- Installing the software for the first time after purchase
- Setting up protection on a new device
- Reinstalling after a system format or hardware upgrade
- Transferring your subscription to another computer
- Correcting a failed installation or corrupted software
- Resolving technical issues that require a fresh installation

Knowing how to locate and download your previously purchased Webroot product can save time and prevent gaps in your digital protection.

Step-by-Step: How to Download Webroot After Purchase
-----------------------------------------------------

The process of downloading Webroot after you’ve already made a purchase is straightforward, but it varies slightly depending on how and where you bought the product. Follow the steps below based on your situation.

**Step 1: Locate Your Product Keycode**

Before downloading the software, make sure you have your 20-character alphanumeric product keycode. This is essential for activating your subscription and verifying your purchase.

Your keycode can be found in one of the following places:

- In your purchase confirmation email
- On the back of the retail card (for boxed purchases)
- In your Webroot online account dashboard
- On a sticker if Webroot came pre-installed on your device

Keep this keycode secure and easily accessible during the installation process.

**Step 2: Access the Webroot Download Page**

Open your preferred internet browser and go to the official Webroot website. Navigate manually to the “Downloads” section to avoid any unofficial or third-party versions that may pose a security risk.

Choose the version of Webroot that corresponds with your purchase:

- Webroot SecureAnywhere AntiVirus
- Webroot Internet Security Plus
- Webroot Internet Security Complete
- Webroot Business Endpoint Protection

Download the correct installer file for your operating system (Windows or macOS).

**Step 3: Run the Installer File**

Once the download is complete:

- Locate the installer file (usually named something like `wsainstall.exe` for Windows or `Webroot.dmg` for Mac).
- Double-click the file to begin the installation.
- If prompted by your system, allow the installer to make changes to your device.

**Step 4: Enter Your Keycode**

During the installation, the software will prompt you to enter your keycode. Enter it carefully and avoid typing errors, as the code is case-sensitive and must be exactly 20 characters long.

After entering your keycode, proceed with the installation by following the on-screen instructions.

**Step 5: Complete Installation and Setup**

Once the keycode is validated:

- The program will begin a quick scan of your device.
- You may be asked to create or log in to your Webroot account.
- Adjust settings as needed or use the default protection profile.
- When complete, Webroot will run in the background and provide real-time protection.

How to Reinstall Webroot on a New Device
----------------------------------------

If you’ve purchased Webroot and want to install it on a different device, the process is similar. However, keep the following points in mind:

- Check your subscription plan to see how many devices are allowed.
- Deactivate or uninstall Webroot on the old device if needed.
- Use the same product keycode when installing on the new device.
- Log in with the same Webroot account to sync settings and manage your license.

Downloading Webroot from Your Online Account
--------------------------------------------

If you registered your product with a Webroot account, you can download your software directly from your account dashboard.

Follow these steps:

**1. Log into your Webroot account.**  
Use the email and password associated with your purchase.

Sometimes, users encounter issues when trying to download Webroot even after purchasing it. Here are some common problems and solutions:

**Problem: Installer won’t download or run**

- Disable any conflicting antivirus software temporarily
- Clear your browser’s cache and try again
- Make sure your internet connection is stable

**Problem: Keycode is not accepted**
